# <%= config.name %> Setup

Please follow the below steps to get started, if you encounter any issues installing the dependencies or provisioning the development environment, please check the [Common Issues](#common-issues) section first.

## Clone the project

Clone the project into your local file system:

```bash
git clone <%= config.git_url %>
```

## Development Environment

### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

##### General

- A GitHub Token
  - This can be generated at [GitHub](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
- Access to LastPass
- Access to AWS
  - If you do not have access you can request it from support.
- Tideways API Key
  - If you wish to run tideways profiling on your development environment, you will find this in LastPass.

##### Docker

- A working docker setup
  - On MacOS, use [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
  - On Linux, add the official Docker repository and install the "docker-ce" package.

##### MacOS

Set up docker-sync to improve volume performance:
```bash
gem install docker-sync
```

#### Setup

During setup you will be asked for Github and AWS credentials, please use the details from the prerequisites.

```bash
make setup
make start
echo "$(make ip) <%= config.hostname %>" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
docker-compose logs -f web setup
```

Once the environment is running, you should be able to browse to the site at
[https://<%= config.hostname %>](https://<%= config.hostname %>)

### Usage

```
Usage:
  make <target> [--] [<command>...] [options]

Targets:
  help            show this help message.
  build           create the application docker image.
  setup           initial project setup and configuration.
  composer        alias to run composer within the application container.
  start           start the application and associated containers.
  stop            stop the application and associated containers.
  restart         stop and start the application and associated containers.
  destroy         remove application containers, network and volumes.
  reset           alias to destroy, build and start the application.
  ip              retrieve IP of web container
  test            run tests
  test-phpspec    run phpspec examples
  db-console      open mysql console in the database container
  db-dump         create db dump
  db-restore      restores the database to it's initial development state
```

### Customising

1. Change the variables that you want to in the `docker-compose.override.yml`
   - `RUN_BUILD` being `false` will stop the build from running each time you bring up your environment.
   - `XDEBUG_REMOTE_ENABLED` can be turned on to allow Xdebug to connect and debug the site. We recommend to turn off Tideways when Xdebug is on.
   - `TIDEWAYS_ENABLED` can be turned off to allow Xdebug to not pick up `tideways.php` as the entry point for the application.
2. Restart your environment: `make restart`

### Xdebug setup

1. Set `XDEBUG_REMOTE_ENABLED` to `true` and `TIDEWAYS_ENABLED` to `false` in `docker-compose.override.yml`
2. Restart your environment: `make restart`
3. Run `ssh -p 2222 forward@localhost -N -R 9000:localhost:9000` in another tab
4. In PHPStorm, configure a web server with path mapping /app/ to the project directory.
5. In PHPStorm, click the listen for connections button in the top right
6. In your browser, use an extension to set the right cookies to trigger Xdebug.

## ContinuousPipe remote environment

1. Request access from the team in #<%= config.name %> to see [the ContinuousPipe Project](https://ui.continuouspipe.io/project/<%= config.name %>/flows)
2. Set up [CP Remote](https://docs.continuouspipe.io/remote-development/getting-started/)
3. Go to the "<%= config.name %>" project on ContinuousPipe
4. Set up a development environment using the "Developer Environments" tab
5. Copy the command it gives you to your terminal (note, do not share the token it gives you with anyone!)
6. Wait for the build to finish
7. Answer which pod you would like to connect to by default. This will probably be "web".
8. Run `cp-remote watch` to sync your local filesystem changes with the remote environment.
9. In another tab, run `cp-remote bash` to log in to your remote "web" container.
10. Develop away, ask in #<%= config.name %> or #continuous-pipe on Slack if you run into problems!

The credentials for the HTTP auth that will be needed if you are on a non-whitelisted IP Address can be found in the
Lastpass entry `<%= config.name %> on CP: HTTP Basic Auth` in the folder `Shared-<%= config.name %>-Accounts`

#### XDebug Setup
This will only work on development environments, as `sshforward` is only deployed there.

1. In a `cp-remote bash` session, run the following to enable xdebug, disable tideways and increase the timeout for PHP requests to 10000 seconds:
```
XDEBUG_REMOTE_ENABLED="true" TIDEWAYS_ENABLED="false" PHP_MAX_EXECUTION_TIME="10000" container confd && pkill php-fpm && pkill nginx
```
2. On your machine in another terminal window, run `cp-remote forward -s sshforward 2222:22`
3. On your machine in another terminal window, run `ssh -p 2222 forward@localhost -N -R 9000:localhost:9000`
4. Configure PHPStorm or your desired IDE to listen for requests on port 9000.

## Hem VM

#### Install Dependencies

1. Install the latest version of Hem from [inviqa/hem on GitHub](https://github.com/inviqa/hem)

2. Install the latest version of Vagrant from [http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)

#### Provision Environment

You can now build the development environment for the first time. In the project directory, execute the following command:

    $ hem vm up

You should now be able to access the site at [http://<%= config.hostname %>](http://<%= config.hostname %>)

#### Hem Usage

With the Hem enabled environment up and running please make use of the following commands for day to day usage.

```bash
hem vm start  # Starts the vm without the overhead of provisioning
hem vm stop   # Graceful halt of the vm
hem vm ssh    # Start an SSH session on the VM
hem vm mysql  # Connect to the database on the VM
```

#### Common Issues

As setup issues are encountered please detail with step by step fix instructions, and where possible update the project itself to provide a more permanent fix.

   Please remove any <%= config.hostname %> entries from your hosts file and retry
